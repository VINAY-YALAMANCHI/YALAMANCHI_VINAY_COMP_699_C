# AI-Interview Simulator

## Overview

The AI-Interview Simulator is a role-specific, AI-powered application developed by TechSkill Solutions to help students and professionals prepare for job interviews. It uses speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP) to simulate realistic interview scenarios. Candidates receive automated feedback on both the content and delivery of their responses, enabling continuous improvement in communication skills, answer quality, and confidence.

## Project Objectives

- Provide an interactive and adaptive interview practice platform.
- Deliver instant feedback based on spoken answers.
- Support content and delivery scoring using automated systems.
- Allow admin users to manage content, review sessions, and configure scoring rules.
- Ensure secure and compliant data handling.

## User Roles

### Candidate
- Selects a specific role (e.g., Software Engineer, Data Scientist).
- Configures question difficulty and time limits.
- Hears and reads questions using Text-to-Speech (TTS).
- Records spoken responses via built-in audio recorder.
- Receives:
  - Instant transcriptions
  - Content feedback (keyword match and semantic similarity)
  - Delivery feedback (filler words, pauses, speaking rate)
  - Final integrated score
  - Improvement recommendations
- May re-record answers, pause/resume sessions, and export session reports.

### Content Manager
- Manages question bank (add/edit/delete).
- Defines role, difficulty, keywords, model answers, and follow-up questions.
- Adjusts thresholds for feedback metrics and scoring weightings.

### Reviewer
- Views and manually corrects system-generated transcriptions.
- Overrides automated scores based on review.
- Filters and searches session history.
- Exports session logs and reports.

### System Administrator
- Configures adaptive questioning logic.
- Handles system notifications and fallback mechanisms.
- Ensures secure storage with encryption and access control.
- Manages user consent and data privacy disclosures.
- Implements error logging and retry mechanisms.

## Key Functional Requirements

- Text-to-Speech for question delivery.
- Automatic transcription of candidate responses.
- Detection of filler words using predefined patterns.
- Analysis of pause durations and speaking rate.
- Scoring based on:
  - Content relevance (keyword match and semantic similarity)
  - Delivery quality (fluency metrics)
- Adaptive questioning based on previous performance.
- Combined scoring using predefined weighted formulas.
- Export of session data in PDF and CSV formats.

## Data Privacy and Security

- All candidate audio, transcripts, scores, and feedback are securely stored with encryption and controlled access.
- Explicit consent is required before recording or storing personal data.
- System displays data usage disclaimers before each session.

## Error Handling and System Logging

- Automatic retries for failed recordings.
- Fallback to text display if TTS fails.
- Logging of all system events, exceptions, and failures for debugging and audit purposes.

## Export and Reporting

- Candidates and Reviewers can export session data including audio files, transcripts, scores, and feedback.
- Reports are available in PDF and CSV formats for review and offline analysis.

## Conclusion

The AI-Interview Simulator is a comprehensive and scalable solution for interview preparation, designed to support continuous improvement through AI-driven insights, adaptive logic, and structured feedback mechanisms.
